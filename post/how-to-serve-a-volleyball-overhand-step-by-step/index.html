An overhand serve in volleyball is a serve in which the player tosses the ball with one hand and strikes it in the air above their head with the other hand. Remember that you want your dominant hand to make contact with the ball just after it changes direction and begins to drop back down. To serve harder the hand must move faster. Shift weight to lead foot (or step forward) as you make contact with the ball.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/77/53/297753456b4e38aa64b0f8ab992c0f06.jpg alt="Pin On Casie" title="Pin On Casie" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Cues used in overhand serving are toss and draw and step and swing. Remember that practice makes perfect. When the serve technique is not correct, then the serve is often more a liability than an asset.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to serve a volleyball overhand step by step by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
