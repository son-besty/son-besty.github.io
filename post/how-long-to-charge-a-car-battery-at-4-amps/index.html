When a battery charger says it is charging at 2 amps or 10 amps it is describing the number of amps it is delivering to the battery per hour. That means in one hour the battery will receive a charge of 2 amperes and in 10 hours, it will receive a charge of 20 amperes and so on. All in all, it should take about 7 hours to charge. For example if a battery is rated as, say 8ah, it will be able to provide 4 amps for 2 hours.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4h19F0Fqays/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Pin On Changing System" title="Pin On Changing System" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

In short, the minimum charging current is usually around 0.1c, or the charging will last simply too long to be practical. When a battery charger says it is charging at 2 amps or 10 amps it is describing the number of amps it is delivering to the battery per hour. This could be a good choice for charging your car battery to maintain a certain level for a long. The battery of a car, particularly the new ones, can stay charged by drawing power from the car’s engine.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b9/9d/31/b99d314b1694149ccf30f88a0990dd55.png alt="Nexpow Car Battery Starter 1500a Peak 21800mah 12v Portable Auto Car Battery Charger Jump Starter Battery Pack With Usb Quick Charge 30 Type-c Up To 65l Ga In 2021 Car Battery" title="Nexpow Car Battery Starter 1500a Peak 21800mah 12v Portable Auto Car Battery Charger Jump Starter Battery Pack With Usb Quick Charge 30 Type-c Up To 65l Ga In 2021 Car Battery" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

So, if your battery has 48 amp hours, that simply means you need to charge your battery for a whole day. At this rate, it typically takes over 24 hours to fully charge the battery. But then, as the battery builds up resistance, the amps begin to taper off, and taper off more quickly as the battery becomes increasingly charged. There are also circumstances where good car batteries run out of power due to overuse or car defects that directly affect the normal charge and use of the battery.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6e/75/dd/6e75ddc84db5051382eaa76c5034ab3d.jpg alt="Car-battery Welding Car Battery Battery Welding" title="Car-battery Welding Car Battery Battery Welding" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The charging time heavily depends on the car battery and the charger’s power output. So, if your battery has 48 amp hours, that simply means you need to charge your battery for a whole day.

At this rate, it typically takes over 24 hours to fully charge the battery. We should charge an additional 3.25ah by charging with 0.5a current for about 7 hours.
