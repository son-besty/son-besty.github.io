Charging a normal car battery with a regular car charger of around 8 amperes can take 12 hours or even a whole day to fully charge it. It’s always better to use a battery charger to bring your battery up to at least 12.5 volts. If using a low amp charger it can take up to 24 hours to charge your battery properly but a high amperage charger such as a 40 amp charger will get the job done adequately in an hour or less and will get you on the road again in only a few minutes.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/aa/4b/76/aa4b76c592e18145ec164c84d86fac30.jpg alt="10 Best Car Battery Chargers Best Battery Charger Charge Battery Car Battery Charger" title="10 Best Car Battery Chargers Best Battery Charger Charge Battery Car Battery Charger" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The length of time it takes to charge a battery has a lot to do with the type of battery charger you have, said benjamin jerew, an ase master mechanic since 2001. If you are charging from empty, it will take longer to charge than if you are topping up from 50%. Just like the dynamo powering up the light on an old bicycle, the petrol or diesel engine powers up the battery whenever it runs low.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Hn8FMRv_DM/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Car Battery Charge Times With Any Amp Charger Home Battery Bank" title="Car Battery Charge Times With Any Amp Charger Home Battery Bank" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Charging your battery this way often requires a battery to be charged beforehand by an amp charger. The risks to using your car to charge a flat battery aren’t great, but they are real. If you are charging from empty, it will take longer to charge than if you are topping up from 50%. This means that when charging the example battery with a 10 amp charger, it will take 3.6 hours to fully charge.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/30/a0/2b/30a02b81e8223cf6927bfa79b42e7c36.jpg alt="Noco Genius10 10-amp Fully-automatic Smart Charger 6v And 12v Battery Charger Battery Main Smart Charger Battery Charger Car Battery Charger" title="Noco Genius10 10-amp Fully-automatic Smart Charger 6v And 12v Battery Charger Battery Main Smart Charger Battery Charger Car Battery Charger" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

So, the charge rate decreases and charge time. Charging a battery with a car battery charger enough that it can start the car engine will take around 2 to 4 hours. Using the example above, it would take around 4.5 hours to recharge that battery.
