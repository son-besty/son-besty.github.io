Then rub the wet cotton over ink from one end of the mark to the other, rather than wiping across the mark.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fd/b5/5a/fdb55a1431e18a2caf31b158788fb55d.jpg alt="Spot Finish Old Wood Floors Old Wood Floors Pine Wood Flooring Sanding Wood Floors" title="Spot Finish Old Wood Floors Old Wood Floors Pine Wood Flooring Sanding Wood Floors" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
