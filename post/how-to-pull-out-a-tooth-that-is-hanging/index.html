It is quite difficult to pull out a very loose tooth without any pain at all, unless the tooth is literally just ready to fall out. Sometimes a loose tooth can hang around for a few weeks before coming out. If the tooth is still hanging by a thread and just won’t fall out, you can try to gently pull it. This is because a hanging tooth almost always means that it is not entirely ready to go, and tugging on it might lead to pain and bleeding.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Pull-Out-a-Tooth-Without-Pain-Step-2-Version-5.jpg/v4-460px-Pull-Out-a-Tooth-Without-Pain-Step-2-Version-5.jpg alt="The 3 Best Ways To Pull Out A Tooth Without Pain Wikihow" title="The 3 Best Ways To Pull Out A Tooth Without Pain Wikihow" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
