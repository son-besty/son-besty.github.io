The switch leg from one light is run to the first 3 way and a switch leg from another light is run to the other 3 way. When you make use of your finger or the actual circuit along with your eyes, it is easy to mistrace the circuit. The s witch legs are at both ends. Take another 14/3 cable and make yet another junction of white wires and attach the junction to the white screw of the light.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/0a/3d/a9/0a3da904a1f13889de9bdb0e0ca66feb.jpg alt="3 Way And 4 Way Switch Wiring For Residential Lighting Tom Remus Electric Light Switch Wiring 4 Way Light Switch Electrical Switches" title="3 Way And 4 Way Switch Wiring For Residential Lighting Tom Remus Electric Light Switch Wiring 4 Way Light Switch Electrical Switches" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Take another 14/3 cable and make yet another junction of white wires and attach the junction to the white screw of the light. We are including pdf files, so you can see the picture in greater detail (schematic & wiring). Next, bend the wire into a pig tail loop so that you can easily attach to the screws on the light switch. Print the electrical wiring diagram off and use highlighters in order to trace the signal.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ec/f3/78/ecf378f60818523ad537b5c706ff276a.jpg alt="Wiring A 4-way Switch Home Electrical Wiring Electrical Wiring Wire Switch" title="Wiring A 4-way Switch Home Electrical Wiring Electrical Wiring Wire Switch" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Meaning that it is the only box you could tap into. The same wire goes to the black terminal of the second bulb and you. This white wire is wrapped with black tape to mark it as hot. You still have the white wire remaining.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to wire a 4 way switch with 2 lights by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
