Source: parents.com</p><p>Congrats on ur new bub! One thing that disturbs a baby sleeping in arms is to be placed on a cold mattress, i think this is another reason they suggest putting baby to bed in a drowsy state. Another suggestion to try is transition slowly, so start with one nap in the bassinet/crib and gradually work your way to full time.

Whenever i put him down, he wakes up.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://babybassinetworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/List-of-Bassinet-Up-To-6-to-12-Months.jpg alt="Baby From 6 To 12 Month-old List Of 7 Best Bassinets" title="Baby From 6 To 12 Month-old List Of 7 Best Bassinets" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Make sure those happen at home, and that they are close to an hour. Another suggestion to try is transition slowly, so start with one nap in the bassinet/crib and gradually work your way to full time.
