As a rule of thumb you should not eat below 1200 calories for female and 1600 calories for male. One of the nasty little things about losing weight is that as your body gets smaller you require fewer calories to maintain your body weight. Vegetables are super low in calories because most of them are 70 to 90 percent water.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://betterme.world/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-3449-1024x576.png alt="Losing 50 Pounds In 3 Months Is It Possible" title="Losing 50 Pounds In 3 Months Is It Possible" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
