Source: reddit.com</p><p>I believe my tires say every 5,000 miles but my dealer said they didn�t need to be rotated at all at my 10,000 mile service. 7,500 is just insane because then you can’t use your maintenance required light for tire rotation reminder unless it’s every other time. I rotate and balance every 5,000 (just because my tire package includes it all for free). However, some vehicles are exceptions and it’s always best to refer to your owner’s manual. Generally, wheel balancing can take 40 minutes to 2 hours depending on several factors.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/76/25/af/7625af790b950ff4eb9782b101718d39.png alt="Pin On Diy Car Maintenance" title="Pin On Diy Car Maintenance" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
