If you run a cat 5/6 ethernet cable of your security camera, you can just drill a hole to run the ethernet cable from the camera to your home router or nvr. Create access holes in the drywall that are roughly 4 inches by 4 inches, enough so you can insert your hands and a drill to cut a hole in the studs for fishing through the wire.

This involves paying attention to rooms that actually need cabling.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.imgur.com/ridnI.jpg alt="How Do I Run Ethernet Cable Through A Wall Cavity - Home Improvement Stack Exchange" title="How Do I Run Ethernet Cable Through A Wall Cavity - Home Improvement Stack Exchange" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
