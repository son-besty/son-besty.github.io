Mix relatively small amounts of mortar mix so that water will not be absorbed by the materials and will not frost.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a2/ae/66/a2ae6644b6d93054ba30fe00ba284e15.jpg alt="Con097-4 - Materia Concrete Heavy And Light Concrete Texture" title="Con097-4 - Materia Concrete Heavy And Light Concrete Texture" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Concrete set time at 70 degrees is approximately 5 hours, at 50 degrees it is 10 hours, at 30 degrees it�s up to 20 hours (if the concrete doesn�t freeze!). However, concrete drying is a continuous and fluid event, and usually reaches its full effective strength after about 28 days.
