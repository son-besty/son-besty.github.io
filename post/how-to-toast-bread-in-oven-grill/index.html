Get the oven rack and place it on the highest shelf position. Pieces of bread around the outer edges aren’t going to brown as evenly or as quickly as the slices in the middle. The best way to evenly toast bread is in a convection oven or toaster oven. Keep a close watch, because it’ll toast up very quickly.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/05/89/4605890a550e38862ffabd6e8fe37437.jpg alt="Big Batch Toasted Cheese Sandwiches Recipe Recipes Food Sandwiches" title="Big Batch Toasted Cheese Sandwiches Recipe Recipes Food Sandwiches" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
