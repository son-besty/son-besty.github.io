William wildgoose’s bsava manual of ornamental fish health mentions clove oil as a technique for killing fish at 10 drops per litre as a minimal dose, noting that clove oil can be properly dissolved by mixing with a little hot water first. Cut through the gill rakers on one side of the fish. If your fish is still swimming around after 5 minutes, add a couple more drops of the clove oil mixture. The spike should be placed in a position to penetrate the brain of the fish and then pushed quickly and firmly into the skull.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how to euthanize a fish with ice water by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
