Then dip each slice in ascorbic acid or lemon water mixture.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/48/d2/da/48d2dafb092c26f8827601eb3a97ca76.jpg alt="Mary Washington Asparagus Seeds Asparagus Officinalis Asparagus Seeds Growing Asparagus Asparagus" title="Mary Washington Asparagus Seeds Asparagus Officinalis Asparagus Seeds Growing Asparagus Asparagus" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
