Cashmere can be a tricky material to work with. Add 2 capfuls or a squirt of wool & cashmere shampoo to a washbasin or sink filled with cool water. Cashmere is breathable and if you wear it throughout the day without any spills or stains, you can hang it up and wear it again. Place the coat on the towels shaping it so that it is as smooth as possible.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d5/5b/a7/d55ba7fa2fe149f59a1e8cb4bfb88890.png alt="Theory Shawl Collar Wool Cashmere Coat Women - Bloomingdales Cashmere Coat Wool Coat Outfit Coat" title="Theory Shawl Collar Wool Cashmere Coat Women - Bloomingdales Cashmere Coat Wool Coat Outfit Coat" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
