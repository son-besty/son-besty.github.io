The first player vertically holds all pick up sticks touch in one hand making sure that one end of the sticks remains in with the playing area, the player quickly releases his/her hand and lets the sticks scatter. Pick up sticks is a game that sounds simple, but challenges a player’s ability to keep their hands steady and their minds focused.
