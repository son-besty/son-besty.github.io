After picking up one stick, you can go ahead and pick up another stick. An important rule is to not make any other sticks move, otherwise you lose your turn and won’t get the stick. Hold the sticks in a bunch vertically over a flat surface but keep the black stick separate. Player one begins the game by holding all of the sticks in their hand and then dropping them to the ground, scattering them across the floor.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/73/a7/86/73a7868d2d6806251ad9b79faa735edf.jpg alt="Diy Pick-up Sticks Game From Chopsticks Pick Up Sticks Chopsticks Crafts Chopsticks Diy" title="Diy Pick-up Sticks Game From Chopsticks Pick Up Sticks Chopsticks Crafts Chopsticks Diy" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
