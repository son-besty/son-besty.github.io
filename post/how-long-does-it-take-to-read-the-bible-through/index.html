The bible in 90 days is a bible reading plan created by ted cooper in 2002, designed to walk you through the bible over the course of just three months. I personally believe christians should try to read through the entire bible every year, but this may not be best for everyone. Follow edited jul 11 �14 at 13:31.

Realistically though, it would be more wise to use a reading plan and spend a few minutes each day reading the bible. I had devoured the word of god. It takes only 52 hours and 20 minutes to read the old testament, and just 18 hours and 20 minutes to read the new testament. When your brain wears out, change up what you do.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8d/6f/55/8d6f552c429ad6ef347d13e7208f4cbe.png alt="Bible In 90 Days Reading Schedule Cover To Cover Bible Reading Schedule Read Bible Scripture Reading" title="Bible In 90 Days Reading Schedule Cover To Cover Bible Reading Schedule Read Bible Scripture Reading" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I decided to read the bible within 30 to 45 days, so i divided the number of pages by the amount of days i wanted to complete reading it, and that gave me the total number of pages to read each day.
