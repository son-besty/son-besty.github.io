Polish your cufflinks using a soft cloth to wipe away the accumulated grime and dust, then store in a leather cufflink case or compartmentalized box. You can damn well wear cufflinks without a jacket until your heart’s content. Fold the cuffs on the shirt and align the holes at the bottom, outside wrist edge. But to start, i think a plain white or light blue shirt works well because you can have all kinds of cufflinks on them.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/92/01/8392015ec384d26325af2df70b05668e.jpg alt="How To Wear Cufflinks A Mans Guide To Buying Cufflinks Cufflinks Men Cufflinks Real Men Real Style" title="How To Wear Cufflinks A Mans Guide To Buying Cufflinks Cufflinks Men Cufflinks Real Men Real Style" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Cufflinks must be worn with a french cuffed dress shirt. If the suit is simple, opt for more subtle cufflinks. To lock the links in place, the cylinder is flipped outward, leaving the frame in place as the post.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/11/88/22118855f78ac25de3878e245cae86be.jpg alt="The Perfect Dress Shirts For Suit Perfect Dress Shirt Mens Accessories Cufflinks" title="The Perfect Dress Shirts For Suit Perfect Dress Shirt Mens Accessories Cufflinks" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
