The bible does not tell us precisely how long it took noah to build the ark. The actual time it took noah to construct the ark may have been as little of 25 years. Genesis 6:3 says, “and the lord said, my spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: Noah was more than 500 years old when his first son was born, and he was 600 years old when the flood occurred.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f6/e0/c9/f6e0c9d91379c964fac25400aef7ae32.jpg alt="Pin On Noahs Ark Resources" title="Pin On Noahs Ark Resources" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

How long was noah on the ark, seven days later, the flood’s rains began (genesis 7:11)? “noah was six hundred years old when the flood came, waters upon the earth.” so we see that the ages of people then was.

Could noah build the ark in 70 years?</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/b7/60/b5b7601ca30a5959a7d24f386d7f782d.jpg alt="Pin On Quick Bible Facts" title="Pin On Quick Bible Facts" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
