Source: gamerevolution.com</p><p>After placing the sell order, robinhood will ask you to transfer the money from your account by bank wire or ach transfer. Before you can process any withdrawals through robinhood, your funds need to “settle”, which means that at least 2 trading days need to pass before your sale funds will turn into withdrawable funds. For example, if you win one share worth $10 to your account, you can’t withdraw the $10 you receive by selling the stock until thirty days have passed. The cash value of the stock is determined by the price of the stock at the time you received it. They are funds that simply haven’t cleared yet.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.wallstreetsurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cash-Management-Review-768x432.png alt="Robinhood Cash Management Review - The Facts - Wall Street Survivor" title="Robinhood Cash Management Review - The Facts - Wall Street Survivor" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
