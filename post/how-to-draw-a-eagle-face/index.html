Simply pressing harder on one side with the brown crayon, or adding a touch of gray to the head, will make the bird instantly look more round. Draw an outline of upper part of the wing. These are its eyes, feet, wings, and of course, its massive body. The head of the eagle is white so i did not draw many lines on it, only the minimum to show the shades under the beak and around the eye area.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/91/fb/54/91fb54a5793a48c870e7e2cac89a00ac.jpg alt="Eagles Eye By H3llb0und On Deviantart Eagle Drawing Eagle Sketch Eagle Pictures" title="Eagles Eye By H3llb0und On Deviantart Eagle Drawing Eagle Sketch Eagle Pictures" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Welcome back to art diarium today i am going to show you how to draw an eagle (sketching + coloring) with colored pencils. For a more dangerous type, we’ll draw a line above the eye a little at an angle, as we do with eyebrows when we draw an evil person. Do not press hard on the pencil, as these are only auxiliary contours, which will be further detailed. Body of bald eagle is dark brown so here we use a softer pencil 2b or 4b. Next, divide the lower half of the oval into quarters using horizontal lines.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e1/62/3e/e1623ede80b7e3557f8c8690e4087100.jpg alt="How To Sketch An Eagle Step By Step Drawing Guide By Dawn Dragoartcom Eagle Drawing Eagle Face Drawings" title="How To Sketch An Eagle Step By Step Drawing Guide By Dawn Dragoartcom Eagle Drawing Eagle Face Drawings" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
