After your quick oil change service is completed, one of the first things that you want to check is that the oil is filled to its proper level. In order to inspect the engine oil level correctly, you need to make sure the vehicle is parked on a fairly level location, shut the engine off, open the hood, allow the oil to drain back into the engine oil pan for a few minutes, then locate the engine oil dipstick which usually has a bright yellow handle that reads engine oil. Had the oil checked at the 10,000 mile checkup and tthe gauge showed 3/4 of the way between the marks. For example, my 4.3 l chevrolet engine in my blazer takes 4 1/2 quarts of oil.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f5/82/a4/f582a46d2415aa2824309594e357bbea.jpg alt="Fall Home Maintenance Checklist - Free Printable Home Maintenance Checklist Chimney Cleaning Home Maintenance" title="Fall Home Maintenance Checklist - Free Printable Home Maintenance Checklist Chimney Cleaning Home Maintenance" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
