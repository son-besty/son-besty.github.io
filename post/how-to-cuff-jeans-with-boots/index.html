Today i am showing you how to create a more stylish look by cuffing your jeans. A more casual look to try that is also fairly easy to pull off is to cuff your skinny jeans by rolling them up at the ankle once or twice to create a single cuff or double cuff. Roll the bottom of your jeans up 1 inch (2.5cm), and keep rolling until they are the right height to expose a little bit of your ankle.
