I got a cotton cloth, dipped a portion of it in a little clorox, and applied it to the sting. The area should be well drenched, especially on and around suspected nest. Yellow jacket activity won’t stop overnight, so observe the nest from a safe distance over the next several days following treatment. Killing yellow jackets in this manner works well for the occasional wasp.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how to kill yellow jackets underground by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
