Do not apply grout sealant immediately after the floor tiles installed.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://universealsealants.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/porcelain-tiles-500x383.jpg alt="How Long Does Grout Sealer Take To Dry Professional Answer" title="How Long Does Grout Sealer Take To Dry Professional Answer" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
