I started playing guitar again a few years ago, after many years of not playing. Use big bold movements from your forearm. Place the guitar pick on top of your index finger with a little less than half an inch sticking out. For strumming, you can hold it with thumb, index and middle finger.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to hold a guitar pick properly by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
