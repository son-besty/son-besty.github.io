After about a minute, to allow for drainage, make an initial reading of the meniscus, estimating the volume to the nearest 0.01 ml. Calculate the volume of liquid delivered by subtracting the volume from step 2 from the volume in step 6. Pour metal 1 onto weigh boat and record weight of metal 1 added to weigh boat.

Choose a graduated cylinder that the object will easily fit inside. This droop is known as. To find the scale increment, subtract the values of any two adjacent labeled graduations and divide by the number of intervals between them.
