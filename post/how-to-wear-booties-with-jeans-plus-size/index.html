Wearing the bootie under straight, slim, or bootcut jeans or pants (loose enough to not show the bump of the boot top, tight enough for a long leg line) will keep the leg line going, and better show your curves. While ankle boots are most often paired with denim jeans , we think a dress is the most versatile way of wearing your favorite booties. Try your bootie with a skinny jean to give the footwear a bit more attention. Pair distressed jean shorts with a sweater and blazer for the perfect balance of work and play.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ba/0b/f3/ba0bf3476fb4ed32881b5a549cc26563.jpg alt="Curvy Girl Chic Plus Size Sweater Skinny Jeans And Ankle Boots With Blanket Scarf Plus Size Skinny Jeans Plus Size Sweaters Plus Size Outfits" title="Curvy Girl Chic Plus Size Sweater Skinny Jeans And Ankle Boots With Blanket Scarf Plus Size Skinny Jeans Plus Size Sweaters Plus Size Outfits" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
