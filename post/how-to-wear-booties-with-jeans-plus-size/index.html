Wearing the bootie under straight, slim, or bootcut jeans or pants (loose enough to not show the bump of the boot top, tight enough for a long leg line) will keep the leg line going, and better show your curves. While ankle boots are most often paired with denim jeans , we think a dress is the most versatile way of wearing your favorite booties. Try your bootie with a skinny jean to give the footwear a bit more attention.
