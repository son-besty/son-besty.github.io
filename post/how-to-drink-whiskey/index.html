Add a little water or a mixer. Whisky on the rocks is a fairly standard drink, but it might not be the best way to drink your whisky.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/9a/b0/f39ab062069d91b875cf6d74eaf1ec37.jpg alt="Midleton - Barry Crockett Legacy Vodka Bottle Vodka Whisky" title="Midleton - Barry Crockett Legacy Vodka Bottle Vodka Whisky" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
