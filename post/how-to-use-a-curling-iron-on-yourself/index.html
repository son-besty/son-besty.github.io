Allow the roller to preheat for four minutes before use. The double barrel setup lets you weave your hair back and forth to create sexy s waves. Wet hair is not easy to curl.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/39/93/4e/39934ef73230deac383fc6c18849af02.jpg alt="Romantische Locken Selber Machen So Gehen Sie Mit Dem Lockenstab Richtig Um Haben Sie Gewusst Dass Die Waves Hair Tutorial Beach Wave Hair Loose Waves Hair" title="Romantische Locken Selber Machen So Gehen Sie Mit Dem Lockenstab Richtig Um Haben Sie Gewusst Dass Die Waves Hair Tutorial Beach Wave Hair Loose Waves Hair" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Don’t focus too much heat on the ends since they’re the oldest and most abused part of your hair and so most prone to heat damage. Keep twisting until all the hair in the section is on the iron. I have fine hair, color treated, maybe 2 inches longer than yours. At the bottom of your hair, leave a few centimeters to an inch of your hair off of the barrel, as this is what you will hold onto while the rest of the strand curls.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/31/cd/d3/31cdd34e48ec625856342e47ce2107c5.jpg alt="Get It In The Ghd Summer Sale In 2021 Wand Curls Ghd Curling Wand Ghd" title="Get It In The Ghd Summer Sale In 2021 Wand Curls Ghd Curling Wand Ghd" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Twist your curling iron up toward your roots, wrapping the length of the section around it in the process. Again, hold the curling iron vertically with the clasp facing forward. Then comb the hair straight and pick up the curling iron.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to use a curling iron on yourself by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
