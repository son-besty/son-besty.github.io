If you�re playing an electric guitar, then hold your picking hand over the body.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/06/19/99/061999d82de4fab7a316e62a4a5299bd.jpg alt="Why Cant I Travis Pick - Youtube Guitar Lessons Songs Muscle Memory" title="Why Cant I Travis Pick - Youtube Guitar Lessons Songs Muscle Memory" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Hold your picking hand over the sound hole on your acoustic guitar or over the body if you are playing electric. You should hold the pick whichever way feels comfortable to you. Don’t move your whole arm to strum your guitar.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to hold a guitar pick acoustic by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
