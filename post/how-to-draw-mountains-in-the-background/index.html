A large rocky mountain is the main element for this mountains background where the fog hides the surface. You can use a reference for this step—for example, one of the mountain photos on photodune. Draw the mountain�s peak, and then draw the other side of the mountain down to its base. Use several overlapping curved lines to draw more mountains in the background, taller than the first.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to draw mountains in the background by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
