Treat asparagus like cut flowers or fresh herbs and give them some water to keep them hydrated. During the dormant season (winter) the crowns store energy in the form of carbohydrates that allow the plant to keep growing from year to year. With the cold of winter, these fronds will turn brown and die off. After improving the soil, dig a hole the same size as your pot.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uVyPwtRO8w0/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Six Things To Know Before You Plant Asparagus" title="Six Things To Know Before You Plant Asparagus" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The spears grow off the buds during the growing season. If you can’t get through all your harvested asparagus, it can be frozen and defrosted as needed. You then have the choice of leaving the asparagus bed bare like that, if you get enough snow to cover and insulate the crowns all winter, or mulching the bed.
