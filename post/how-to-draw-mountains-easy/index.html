All right, let�s get started drawing the mountains 2. The three most important things to consider, when drawing mountains is the atmospheric perspective (meaning everything, that is farther away will have a lighter value), clear edges (you have to separate the individual planes by clear defined edges) and finally you need to clearly separate the areas that are hit by light and the ones, that are hit by light. Then add some hatching for the shadows.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/52/3f/f6523f360f7afacaab1da807bb05c00f.jpg alt="How To Draw Mountains Easy - Youtube Mountain Drawing Easy Drawings Mountain Drawing Simple" title="How To Draw Mountains Easy - Youtube Mountain Drawing Easy Drawings Mountain Drawing Simple" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Make a few gradual points on the mountain.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to draw mountains easy by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
