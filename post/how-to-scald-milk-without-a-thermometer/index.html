Be sure that you stir it to prevent burning on the bottom of the pan. Milk scalds at 170 degrees fahrenheit. Once the milk has cooled off a bit, you can either keep it in the refrigerator for roughly 5 days, or put it into the freezer to store.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://326854-1001352-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scald-milk-how-to-make-scalded-milk.jpeg alt="How To Scald Milk - Recipe Vibes" title="How To Scald Milk - Recipe Vibes" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
