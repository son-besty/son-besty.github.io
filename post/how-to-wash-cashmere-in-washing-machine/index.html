We suggest only washing two to three sweaters or up to five smaller pieces, like socks, hats or scarves, at a time and never with other laundry. Place the cashmere sweater in a mesh cloth or a soft pillow cover. Verify that the machine is set to use cold water both for the wash and rinse cycle so that the sweater is not subjected to hot water at any point while it is being cleaned. Avoid that gut reaction to wring it, stresses the expert.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to wash cashmere in washing machine by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
