For a turkey 15 pounds or under, brine for just 24 to 36 hours. To wet brine turkey, combine salt and water (and other optional flavoring ingredients, like honey or molasses, soy sauce, herbs, apple cider and more) and submerge your turkey in the solution. Place in the refrigerator for the specified period of time. Drain the turkey, pat dry, and bring to room temperature an hour before cooking.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how to brine a turkey for baking by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
