Once your flat tire is off the ground, you will need to fully remove it and replace it with the spare tire and then align the spare tire upon the wheel studs. If a flat occurs while on the road, always move the vehicle to a safe location to make the change, even if that means very briefly driving (and at very low speed) on the flat. Yes, one jack stand is probably enough to change a tire, but it’s not great to flex the frame like that for long periods of time, especially not a unibody vehicle. Position your ramp next to the good tire on the side of the car that has the flat.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1d/e0/68/1de0688a64231291f32836280bfd49c4.jpg alt="12v Electric Scissor-type Car Jack Wrench Tire Remover Car Jack Tire Repair Car Tools" title="12v Electric Scissor-type Car Jack Wrench Tire Remover Car Jack Tire Repair Car Tools" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
