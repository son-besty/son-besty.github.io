The reading graduated cylinder worksheets help students in providing questions on how students can read the measurement of a liquid or substance in the cylinder. This should be in the center of the graduated cylinder. The surface of most liquids will be curved slightly down when they are held in a graduated cylinder. A graduated cylinder must be read with the surface of the liquid on the eye level, where the center of the meniscus shows the measuring line.
