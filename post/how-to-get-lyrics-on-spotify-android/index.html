As brandall wrote in this answer, there is no native way to convert audio files to text in android. To get to the lyrics, you initially need to play a song for which you might want to see the lyrics. From there, you can scroll down to see the song�s lyrics. Click “play” then click “sync lyrics”.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how to get lyrics on spotify android by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
