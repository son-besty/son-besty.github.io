After about a day, the cement should be solid enough that you should be able to hang the rest of the fence. The concrete sets up in 20 to 40 minutes, so you can quickly move on to the next stage of the project (a great convenience when setting fence posts) or backfill the hole to finish the job. However, it’s still important to know when your fence post is set and ready to perform its function.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how long does it take for cement to dry for fence posts by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
