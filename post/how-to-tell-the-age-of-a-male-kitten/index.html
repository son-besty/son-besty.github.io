In kittens of similar size, the distance between the anus and the genital opening is greater in the male than the female. Conversely, if the two are almost adjacent on a kitten or less than 1/2 inch apart on an adult, it’s a female. Most cats stop growing at around 6 months of age, but may �fill out� up to around 12 months. When sexing kittens the easiest way to explain the difference is by saying that the distance between the anus and the urinary tract opening is much shorter in a female than in a male.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c4/c8/ec/c4c8ec10168402ab779d3522a1d3b469.png alt="Lend A Paw Enamel Pin Newborn Kittens Feeding Kittens Kittens" title="Lend A Paw Enamel Pin Newborn Kittens Feeding Kittens Kittens" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Very old cats tend to have lots of tartar and be missing teeth, but this depends on if the teeth were brushed or not. By one week of age, the kitten should have doubled her birth weight. Nappier says that this method isn’t foolproof. The kitten at the age of 6 weeks will generally weigh between 16 and 24 oz.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c4/2f/e5/c42fe59e99fee6e84f53936696208313.jpg alt="How To Tell The Difference Between A Male Cat And A Female Cat Pregnant Cat Cat Care Newborn Kittens" title="How To Tell The Difference Between A Male Cat And A Female Cat Pregnant Cat Cat Care Newborn Kittens" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
