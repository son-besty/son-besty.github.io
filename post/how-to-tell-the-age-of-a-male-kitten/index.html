In kittens of similar size, the distance between the anus and the genital opening is greater in the male than the female.

When sexing kittens the easiest way to explain the difference is by saying that the distance between the anus and the urinary tract opening is much shorter in a female than in a male.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c4/c8/ec/c4c8ec10168402ab779d3522a1d3b469.png alt="Lend A Paw Enamel Pin Newborn Kittens Feeding Kittens Kittens" title="Lend A Paw Enamel Pin Newborn Kittens Feeding Kittens Kittens" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
