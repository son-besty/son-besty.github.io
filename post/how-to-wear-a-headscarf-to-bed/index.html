Pull the scarf flat around your head so that it covers the back and sides of your hair. Use an elastic band to tie them in place.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a8/48/ce/a848ce7c88a64be84af52977e43020a5.jpg alt="Im Wearing Sayhijab" title="Im Wearing Sayhijab" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Holding each end of the folded scarf, bring it around to the back of your head. Tie your dreads in a bun. Then, put the scarf around your head and wrap the two ends around it.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to wear a headscarf to bed by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
