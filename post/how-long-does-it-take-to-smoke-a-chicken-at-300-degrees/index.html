Source: mamalovesfood.com</p><p>How long does it take to smoke a chicken? It will also depend on your smoker so be sure to use a good quality, digital thermometer to check it. For me, the best results come when i smoke chicken closer to a pit temp of 350f, because the meat tends to stay juicier with the quicker smoking time and the skin has a chance to crisp. If you set your smoker to 250°f, estimate the cook time to be about 30 to 45 minutes per pound. Remove the baking dish from the oven and remove the foil.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.smokedmeatsunday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Coffee-Brisket-2-Copy-682x1024.jpg alt="Smoked Spatchcock Chicken Smoked Meat Sunday" title="Smoked Spatchcock Chicken Smoked Meat Sunday" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
