As a work around to temperature, why not just weigh the fluid that comes out and replace with an equal weight? A proper fluid change involves the transmission cooler lines being disconnected. If you check this transmission when it’s hot, the expanded fluid will spill out of the check plug hole and the transmission will be low of fluid if you immediately reinstall the plug!</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aa5p4Sx9apU/sddefault.jpg#404_is_fine alt="Transmission Fluid Replacement 8 Steps With Pictures - Instructables" title="Transmission Fluid Replacement 8 Steps With Pictures - Instructables" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
