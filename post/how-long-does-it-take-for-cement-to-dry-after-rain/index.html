Wait at least 24 hours before allowing foot traffic, including pets.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/cc/8c/3dcc8c621caed1cd6b36174cd018f7da.jpg alt="Magic Cement Hidden Concrete Patterns Appear With Water Cement Design Concrete Design Concrete" title="Magic Cement Hidden Concrete Patterns Appear With Water Cement Design Concrete Design Concrete" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Two days without rain is optimal but may not be feasible. It can then take up to 4 days to cure and harden to its maximum strength. What if it rains all 28 days after the concrete has been poured? On the other hand, it can rain so heavily for two straight hours only, but with this severity, it will take.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/b7/b4/b5b7b4f5f73ba1bc4abbd2f1d3133bbb.jpg alt="Innovative Concrete Shows Secret Patterns When Wet Hot Concrete Design Concrete Luxury Beach Houses" title="Innovative Concrete Shows Secret Patterns When Wet Hot Concrete Design Concrete Luxury Beach Houses" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Providing it is dry up to a few hrs after the cement is is laid it should be able to withstand average rain fall. Turn it over and get to the bottom to ensure the mortar is. A minimum of 24 hours drying time is required prior to allowing significant foot traffic and 48 hours for vehicular traffic on the paver surface. If you had time to complete the finishing process and the concrete has stiffened (typically 4 to 8 hours after mixing), rainwater may cause little if any damage.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/d2/82/d3d28243f1484bff95271e879ebdec77.jpg alt="We Create Invisible Street Art That Only Appears When It Rains And You Can Do It Too Street Art Rain Rains" title="We Create Invisible Street Art That Only Appears When It Rains And You Can Do It Too Street Art Rain Rains" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Is it still considered dry enough for the membrane or coating to be installed just because the literature said it. Check the weather forecast before pouring concrete. Generally, it takes about 10 to 12 hours to dry before you can walk on it, but the coating will continue to harden for at least 48 hours after.
