Source: trophyspecialist.com</p><p>I remove the head, neck, and cut the body in half (most times the supplier has already dissected the form in this manner). Make sure you hang the deer by its hind leg prior to skinning, so that it will be easier to pull the hide off. Start by positioning the deer on its back and spread its hind legs. I never hang a deer for any period of time. A rope around the neck or a gambrel through the achilles tendon — that’s how most hang their deer.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to gut a deer for mounting by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
