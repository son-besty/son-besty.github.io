Take the back of your shirt and fold it under so it is the same length as where the front knot will be. You can use the scarf to polish or spice up a simple dress.

Even if you can tie a regular knot, it likely won’t be as secure since the fabric will be stretched further than it should be.

Then, begin tieing a knot but make sure the side without any buttons is on top.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/68/a6/e3/68a6e3e71062b14b79301b836f214486.png alt="Search By Items - Putting Me Together Fashion Shirt Over Dress Fashion Outfits" title="Search By Items - Putting Me Together Fashion Shirt Over Dress Fashion Outfits" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Even if you can tie a regular knot, it likely won’t be as secure since the fabric will be stretched further than it should be. Wear it as the last layer. I like it best tucked under in the back, but to the front or side also works.
