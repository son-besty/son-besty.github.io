The premise is that you acquire a pot and place a quarter or a dollar in it every time you swear.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fe/12/f7/fe12f78959b5679ba250bf535e80fdcf--not-okay-the-story.jpg alt="No More Swearing Coping Skills Anger Managment Social Story Social Emotional Learning Social Stories Social Narratives" title="No More Swearing Coping Skills Anger Managment Social Story Social Emotional Learning Social Stories Social Narratives" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The next time you find yourself yelling, stop what you’re saying, take a few deep breaths, and count to 10. It took me a while to let go of it all.
