Swearing allows you to respond forcibly to other people�s offenses without resorting to physical violence. It will only escalate the situation and make any future attempts to get the person to stop that much harder. The premise is that you acquire a pot and place a quarter or a dollar in it every time you swear.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fe/12/f7/fe12f78959b5679ba250bf535e80fdcf--not-okay-the-story.jpg alt="No More Swearing Coping Skills Anger Managment Social Story Social Emotional Learning Social Stories Social Narratives" title="No More Swearing Coping Skills Anger Managment Social Story Social Emotional Learning Social Stories Social Narratives" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
