During this time, be sure to check on your pet frequently to remind them that they are safe, and you haven’t deserted them. The animals are given free of charge to people who qualify. Their presence may be reassuring hence helping their handler from experiencing frequent anxiety attacks.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5c/36/c7/5c36c7c55719fa510bf3b741bb3b6fbd.jpg alt="Pin By Sharon Duchaine On Animals Service Dogs Quotes Psychiatric Service Dog Service Dogs" title="Pin By Sharon Duchaine On Animals Service Dogs Quotes Psychiatric Service Dog Service Dogs" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
