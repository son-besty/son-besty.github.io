Wrapped is a showcase of what you have been listening to this year, displayed on your app in colourful infographic slides, which you can then share on. Once you’ve done that and logged in, your personal look back at 2021 should appear right on your home screen with the message “your 2021 profile is here” below your six most recent listening tracks. These buttons will open your spotify app, which should now present you with your 2021 wrapped results.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/12/01/13/newFile-7.jpg?width=968&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;crop=968%3A645%2Csmart" alt=_sqizf-bxrb2xm title=_sqizf-bxrb2xm onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
