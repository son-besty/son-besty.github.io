The general recommendation is to get a tire rotation for your vehicle every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. However, you’ll still want to confirm this with your owner’s manual in the event that your model has specific recommendations. If the tires are directional then you swap the rf and rr, lf and lr. Another critical aspect to know about your car’s tires is when they should be replaced instead of rotated.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/honda/civic/2019/oem/2019_honda_civic_sedan_touring_fq_oem_1_1280.jpg alt="2020 Honda Civic Prices Reviews And Pictures Edmunds" title="2020 Honda Civic Prices Reviews And Pictures Edmunds" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
