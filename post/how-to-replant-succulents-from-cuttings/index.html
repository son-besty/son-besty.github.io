By far the most popular and easiest way to propagate succulents from a plant you already have is by planting succulent cuttings. Alternatively, you can cleanly snip a portion of the stem. Don�t water until roots begin to form. Use the rolled paper as a handle to gently pull the plant out of the pot.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/91/28/ab91280752cf568e687c14afe202e8eb.jpg alt="How To Propagate Succulent Plant Cuttings Propagating Succulents Planting Succulents Plant Cuttings" title="How To Propagate Succulent Plant Cuttings Propagating Succulents Planting Succulents Plant Cuttings" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Then water well and let the soil dry out before you water again. Once roots have developed, your new succulent can continue to live in the water (as shown above) or be replanted in. Fill your container with a fast draining succulent and cactus soil and press down lightly on the soil to compact it a little. Grab both sides of the newspaper where they meet forming a circle around the plant.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to replant succulents from cuttings by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
