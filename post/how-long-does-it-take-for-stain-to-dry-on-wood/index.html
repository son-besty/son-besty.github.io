Most wood stains take between 1 hour to 48 hours to completely dry for a single coat of stain in optimal conditions. Light color stain takes 8 hours to dry. The benefit of the dry time is that it allows us to access our floors in between coats.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3f/57/5c/3f575ce8f23cfd7efc1d1984df72c94e.jpg alt="Learn How Long To Let Stain Dry Before Polyurethane Woodworking How To Apply Polyurethane Woodworking Basics" title="Learn How Long To Let Stain Dry Before Polyurethane Woodworking How To Apply Polyurethane Woodworking Basics" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The drying time will vary depending on which stain is being used.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/be/35/25/be3525fd689509f1507bcbb8a72a4c3d.jpg alt="Staining With Paint - Finding Your Joy In The Journey Paint Stained Wood Staining Wood Painting Over Stained Wood" title="Staining With Paint - Finding Your Joy In The Journey Paint Stained Wood Staining Wood Painting Over Stained Wood" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
