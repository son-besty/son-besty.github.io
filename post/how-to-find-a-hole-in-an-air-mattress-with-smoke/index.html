Spray the soapy water on the inflated mattress and press down to force air out of the hole. One thing to note is that more smoke will give more chances to locate the hole. Place the piece of the tissue paper over the surface of the mattress starting from any corner. Look for bubbles to form on the surface of the mattress that will lead you to the leak.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how to find a hole in an air mattress with smoke by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
