Around this time of year when we get a lot of rainfall, we start getting many questions about mushrooms growing in lawns. While they�re mostly harmless you can just pluck them up as you see them. These chemicals will probably kill the mushrooms that are out now, but they will return if you don’t locate and eliminate their food source.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://cdn1-www.liveoutdoors.com/assets/uploads/2016/04/dreamstime_xs_46310395.jpg alt="Ink Caps Common Lawn Mushroom And Choice Wild Edible - Liveoutdoors" title="Ink Caps Common Lawn Mushroom And Choice Wild Edible - Liveoutdoors" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The mushrooms are just the reproductive spores, the fungus itself is living in the soil and there�s no way to get rid of them except to pave your yard with concrete. They usually pop up if the lawn hasn�t fully dried in a while or if there�s a damp spot that stays mostly in the shade. Protecting children and pets from these poisonous mushrooms is very important.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/65/Kill-Mushrooms-Step-13-Version-4.jpg/550px-nowatermark-Kill-Mushrooms-Step-13-Version-4.jpg.webp alt="3 Ways To Kill Mushrooms - Wikihow" title="3 Ways To Kill Mushrooms - Wikihow" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Mix 2 to 3 tablespoons (29.6 to 44.4 ml) of dish soap with 2 gallons (7.57 liters) of water. If you hate them, you can try a preventive fungicide rotation and see if that helps.
