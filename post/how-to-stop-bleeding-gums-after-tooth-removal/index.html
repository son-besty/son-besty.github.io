As for just how much to drink, the recommended amount is three to 4 mugs daily. A herb known as yarrow can be sprinkled over the wound and pressure should be applied. It must be a black tea bag, as other kinds of tea don’t have as much tannin as black tea. Apply pressure on the site with gauze for 15 minutes.</p><h3 id=after-a-tooth-is-extracted-a-dentist-or-oral-surgeon-gives-the-patient-gauze-to-gently-bite-down-on>After a tooth is extracted, a dentist or oral surgeon gives the patient gauze to gently bite down on.</h3><p>We want to know if there�s some way to make the bleeding stop, or at least lay off a little bit. But if you still bleed more heavily after an hour or two, contact your dentist.
