Making your own alcohol ink is an economical alternative to buying alcohol inks and it’s also just a great way to use up any dyes you might have from another project.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5f/36/ef/5f36ef67ddf313ee28edbd77b5ee6794.jpg alt="How To Make Your Own Alcohol Inks Alcohol Ink Crafts Alcohol Ink Alcohol" title="How To Make Your Own Alcohol Inks Alcohol Ink Crafts Alcohol Ink Alcohol" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
