Then opt for a cool undercut, make a bun, and let your curly hair do the rest. Make sure to be gentle with your hair and try to be patient with the process. You can style your hair in a proper bun, which involves separating your hair into two even chunks, neatly and smoothly twisting them together, and then securing the ends with bobby pins. Guys will need at least 6 inches of hair length for a basic man bun.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/34/b5/30/34b5308d19a4f0de1d1ea336cca09d21.jpg alt="Curly Headed Boy Bun Long Hair Styles Men Curly Hair Styles Mens Hairstyles" title="Curly Headed Boy Bun Long Hair Styles Men Curly Hair Styles Mens Hairstyles" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Source: pinterest.com</p><p>How to tie a man bun when you have curly hair is different than how you would do it with straight hair. There are different variations such as the top knot, half bun, full bun and afro bun. Control that frizz with some hair gel for an ideal work hairstyle that will have you spending only minutes in front of the mirror each morning. So if your curls on the top of your head are two inches long then the rest of the curls on the sides and back of your head must also be two inches long. On the second pass, stop halfway through to get a bun.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to do a man bun with curly hair by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
