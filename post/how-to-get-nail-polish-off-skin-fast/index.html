(try a 1/2 cup of hydrogen peroxide with a 1/4 cup hot water to start.) then, soak your fingers in the solution while massaging the polish off with your hands. The skin has natural oils that will build up under the nail polish and it will rub off when soaked in warm water. Soak for five minutes, then wipe away the polish with a soft cloth.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/af/9b/89/af9b89e7a69249e04a2e88346f9c55f8.jpg alt="Pin On Products" title="Pin On Products" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
