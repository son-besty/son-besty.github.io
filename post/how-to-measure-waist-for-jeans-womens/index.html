Make sure to keep the tape measure as horizontal as you can. As a result, people started thinking that because their belly button was above the top of their jeans, that “must” be their waist. Using a flexible measuring tape with your feet slightly apart, place the measuring tape above your belly button at the smallest part of your waist.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to measure waist for jeans womens by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
