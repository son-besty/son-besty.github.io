Plant peanuts after the last frost in very sandy soil. Peanuts are simple to grow and like to be planted in full sun. You can even add about 5 cm (2 inches) of mulch on top of the surface if you are concerned that the ground is too hard to grow peanuts or if you have a lot of weeds. The narrower the planting, the faster the soil is covered, but if you plant them too close together, you may not get such a good yield.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4d/c4/21/4dc4217c431c3950ddcee7a81bfdbc24.jpg alt="Growing Peanuts Just For Fun Growing Peanuts Plants Botanical Illustration" title="Growing Peanuts Just For Fun Growing Peanuts Plants Botanical Illustration" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
