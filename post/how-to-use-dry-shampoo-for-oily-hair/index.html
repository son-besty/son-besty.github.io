Prose’s custom dry shampoo uses ingredients like tapioca starch, kaolin clay, witch hazel and rice starch to sop up the excess oil that can burden strands. Apply it directly onto your roots and then use your fingers to shake out any excess to keep residue from building up. Garnier fructis pure clean dry shampoo absorbs hair oil instantly and gives hair the look and feel of a fresh wash.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/f7/ab/11f7abe57d95cf074c4dc785ce9c563d.jpg alt="Diy All-natural Dry Shampoo 2 Ingredients Natural Dry Shampoo Dry Shampoo Diy Dry Shampoo" title="Diy All-natural Dry Shampoo 2 Ingredients Natural Dry Shampoo Dry Shampoo Diy Dry Shampoo" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
