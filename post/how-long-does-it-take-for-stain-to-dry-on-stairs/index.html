A recommended time of 8 hours (minimum) is recommended before applying a topcoat. You’ll want to check on the back of the can to see which timing your particular color requires. The dry time will vary based on such factors as environmental conditions, ventilation, type of wood, and the number of coats. As a result, their drying times can vary from a few hours to a few days.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=http://temptingthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/4-coats-2.jpg alt="Staining Pine Stair Treads Tempting Thyme" title="Staining Pine Stair Treads Tempting Thyme" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Water based stains take a shorter time of 3 to 4 hours to dry than oil based stains. Exterior wood stains can take up to 4 days to completely dry. By letting the stain sit, it will have time to dissolve the prior stain, so when you wipe. Then you would apply second coat and allow to dry overnight and up to 24 hours.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://threecoatsofcharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Stairs-blog-3-1.jpg alt="How To Stain Over Stained Wood Stairs Without Sanding - Three Coats Of Charm" title="How To Stain Over Stained Wood Stairs Without Sanding - Three Coats Of Charm" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
