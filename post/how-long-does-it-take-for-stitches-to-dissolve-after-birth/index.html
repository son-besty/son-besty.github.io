As well as having a tear, or needing a cut, you�re likely to have bruising and swelling in and around your vagina (nhs 2018c). Following a cesarean delivery, a doctor may choose stitches that dissolve within a few weeks. Even if you’ve had a particularly tough delivery, fear not. Stiches used in the repair of various tears will dissolve on their own within six weeks.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/ee/9a/3c/ee9a3c8e03b7fdbc34ac9a588f17f5df.jpg alt="Pin On Pieces Of Wisdom" title="Pin On Pieces Of Wisdom" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

It tends to take between 2 and 4 weeks for stitches between the vagina and back passage (perineum) to heal, but everyone is different and you may find it takes longer. The cut is stitched together using dissolvable stitches after the birth. I guess it depends how bad one tore and how many stitches.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/750x/97/e8/a0/97e8a06bbaec0bb021717a4ae2068ee9.jpg alt="Learning Crochet Beginner Step By Step An Immersive Guide By Elma Craft" title="Learning Crochet Beginner Step By Step An Immersive Guide By Elma Craft" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
