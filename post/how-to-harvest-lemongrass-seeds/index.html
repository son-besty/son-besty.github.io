Lemongrass is harvested for both the stalk and foliage. If playback doesn�t begin shortly, try restarting your device. When large enough to handle, pot into individual pots and keep inside, or on your balcony or terrace after the chance of frost has passed. Others even prefer to use beating sticks to harvest the seeds.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/72/d6/7a/72d67ab1aa0b47fd7f5628c219a0d4f1.jpg alt="Lemongrass - Cymbopogon Flexuosus Container Plants Plants Lemon Grass" title="Lemongrass - Cymbopogon Flexuosus Container Plants Plants Lemon Grass" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
