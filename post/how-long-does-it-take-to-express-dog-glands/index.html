There are two anal sacs (also known as anal glands) inside the anus of dogs and cats.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b6/15/8b/b6158b28bcf94374e089995493b0b695.webp alt="Pin On Dog Grooming Tips" title="Pin On Dog Grooming Tips" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
