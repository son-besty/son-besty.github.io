Source: pinterest.com</p><p>For cutting board cleaning and mold removal, mix 1 teaspoon of bleach into 2 quarts of water. Keep a spray bottle filled with white vinegar and spritz your cutting board whenever it needs to be refreshed (a squeeze of lemon works well here too). The excessive heat and harsh chemicals of the dish detergent will cause the wood to dry. Take your nice smooth board and dip it in water and let it dry. Begin by diluting your chlorine bleach properly.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to clean a wooden cutting board with mold by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
