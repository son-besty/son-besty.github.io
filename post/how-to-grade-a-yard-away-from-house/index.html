The first rule of grading is that the ground should slope away from your house in all directions dropping at least two or three inches every ten feet. Pull the string taut, and tie the end around the second stake. Measure out 10’ from the foundation, and hammer a second stake into the ground. Stretch a nylon string along the foundation wall, 2 inches above the surrounding grade.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ae/ab/c7/aeabc7f79affc4fe979e4a6da0ff48be--yard-drainage-french-drain.jpg alt="Pin On Outdoor Designs My Favorite Place To Be" title="Pin On Outdoor Designs My Favorite Place To Be" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The reason for grading your yard is to move the water/runoff from where it’s currently traveling to a different location. The first rule of grading is that the ground should slope away from your house in all directions dropping at least two or three inches every ten feet.

You will next take stakes and drive them into the ground one foot away from your house’s foundation, as well as a foot away from the end source of drainage on the property.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/a9/d9/f0/a9d9f06fdc54281881af4f1a81fa4cf2--outdoor-landscaping-backyard-patio.jpg alt="Katies Landscape Another Residence Almost Complete Backyard Landscaping Outdoor Landscaping Diy Landscaping" title="Katies Landscape Another Residence Almost Complete Backyard Landscaping Outdoor Landscaping Diy Landscaping" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
