For a quicker drying solution, try applying a fast drying latex with a paint sprayer in a well ventilated area. The paint won’t end up with paint on its fur in the event the cat brushes against the wall. You�ll get fast professional results.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9a/d0/96/9ad096449c133ba4215463c92f6769ca.jpg alt="Diy Wooden Peg Rail With Shelf Design On Her Mind Projetos De Mobiliario Decoracao De Area De Servico Decoracao Sala Apartamento" title="Diy Wooden Peg Rail With Shelf Design On Her Mind Projetos De Mobiliario Decoracao De Area De Servico Decoracao Sala Apartamento" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If you wait too long between edging and painting and don�t mix up the paint well enough. There will not be any marring of the surface should your hand or clothing makes incidental contact with the paint during this 1 st stage. That said, i�ve yet to find any magical wall paint that only takes one coat so by the time you get the second (or sometimes 3rd coat) on you shouldn�t notice it.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/27/c1/6a/27c16a2f47ae9e05ca9aea7f6d152c58.jpg alt="Diy Shelf For The Entryway With Hooks - Shanty 2 Chic Home Home Diy Diy Plank Wall" title="Diy Shelf For The Entryway With Hooks - Shanty 2 Chic Home Home Diy Diy Plank Wall" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If you are applying a primer, you should wait about 24 hours before applying a base coat or enamel based paint. Check the paint can for the recommended drying times and wait until the paint is completely dry before you add the second coat. Be sure to allow proper cure time before returning fixtures, wall plates or frames to the walls.
