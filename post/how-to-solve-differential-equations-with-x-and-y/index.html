A solution for the unknown function u has been found. Show activity on this post. A solution to a differential equation is a function y = f ( x) that satisfies the differential equation when f and its derivatives are substituted into the equation. Multiplying both sides by e 2 x will make it an exact differential equation:</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/44/47/4e/44474ebc72309da4af19f22ae009b9ee.jpg alt="Find The General Solution To The Differential Equation Dydx 4x2sqrt Differential Equations Math Videos Solutions" title="Find The General Solution To The Differential Equation Dydx 4x2sqrt Differential Equations Math Videos Solutions" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

N (y) dy dx = m (x) (1) (1) n ( y) d y d x = m ( x) note that in order for a differential equation to be separable all the y y �s in the differential equation must be multiplied by the derivative and all the x x �s in the differential equation must be on the other side of the equal sign. This is where we actually refer to the differential equation and implement it. Finally solve for y to obtain.
