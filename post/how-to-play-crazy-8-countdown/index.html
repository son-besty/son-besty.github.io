If you don’t have a playable card, tap the pile to draw a card. On a turn, each player adds to the discard pile by playing one card that matches the top card on the discard pile either by suit or by rank (six, jack, ace, etc.). If you can’t play with what you have in your hand, draw one card at a time until you have something to play.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how to play crazy 8 countdown by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
