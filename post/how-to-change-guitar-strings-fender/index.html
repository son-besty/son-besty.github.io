Source: pinterest.com</p><p>To change strings on a fender acoustic guitar, locate the machine post for the string and wind it down. If you plan to change string gauges, you may need to adjust the specs somewhat to compensate for the changes in string sizes. Pull them outwards to bring them out. Make sure you have the correct string and thread the new string through the back of the guitar.
