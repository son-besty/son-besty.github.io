To kill algae, you need to shock the pool ideally with liquid chlorine of up to 1.5l per 10,000l. Are you tried to make the water clean in the pool? It is important to measure your free available chlorine level often and adjust your dispenser as needed to increase or decrease the flow. So, pay attention to the type of chlorine you are using.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.chlorinekingpools.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Joey-2.png alt="Adding Chlorine Still Turning Green - Chlorine King Pool Service - Largo" title="Adding Chlorine Still Turning Green - Chlorine King Pool Service - Largo" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://son-besty.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If the water capacity of your pool falls outside of that, there are chlorine calculators online to assist you in determining the correct quantity of chlorine to add. But a thousand gallons of water since it’s not up to 5000, will consume 3 oz.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how much chlorine to add to pool daily by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
