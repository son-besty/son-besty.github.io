Accordingly, how do you take care of a bonsai tree in the winter? Solid fertilizer diffuses into the soil slowly over time, but is harder to control dosage, which risks burning your tree’s delicate roots. It’s for this reason that we recommend cutting back a month before the winter begins. Keep your bonsai in area with plenty of sunlight.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/26/27/74/2627745f44cdf4238f23f217bcec3458.jpg alt="Great Winter Time Silhouette Bonsai Art Bonsai Bonsai Plants" title="Great Winter Time Silhouette Bonsai Art Bonsai Bonsai Plants" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://shannon-slavin.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Repotting must be performed periodically on your bonsai, winter jasmine included, when its root system has filled the pot. Your bonsai should be kept away from direct heat or draft. Water your tree when the soil feels dry about a centimeter down.
