Wheel wedges go in front of or behind the tires to further ensure the vehicle doesn’t roll while you fix the flat tire. Pull over to a safe place on the side of the road or trail. Pull the tube from the valve first, so as to not damage the valve hole. Roll off the throttle smoothly, gently apply the brake on the wheel that is not flat, and stay centered over the chassis. Run one of the tyre levers around the rest of the tyre, pulling the tyre bead over the wheel rim as you go.</p><h3 id=flat-tires-can-happen-at-any-time-and-place-and-emergency-roadside-assistance-may-not-always-be-available>Flat tires can happen at any time and place, and emergency roadside assistance may not always be available.</h3><p>On the tube, the powder will form a layer that minimizes the tube “bonding” with the inner surface of the tire. Otherwise, you risk getting another flat. Pull the tube from the valve first, so as to not damage the valve hole. On the tire, the talc makes the bead slip over the rim easy, like the soap mentioned in the article, bt it easily transportable. For tubeless mountain bike tires, first check to see if there is a small hole in your tire before removing it.
