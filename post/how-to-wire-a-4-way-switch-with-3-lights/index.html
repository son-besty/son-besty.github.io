How to wire 3 way light switch, in this video we explain how three way switching works to connect a light fitting which is controlled with two light switches. The neutrals should be spliced and pass through the middle switch box, then splice to the neutral wire that goes to the light fixture at the last switch box. Now, in the back of that box i see plain separation between the wires to the left switch, and the wires to the right switch. Currents should always be equal in each cable, and that means a second wire would need to cross over too.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.handymanusa.com/articles/4way.gif alt="Handyman Usa - Wiring A 3-way Or 4-way Switch" title="Handyman Usa - Wiring A 3-way Or 4-way Switch" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://sonodimulyo.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
